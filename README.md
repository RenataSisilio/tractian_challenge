# Tractian Challenge

This is my implementation of the [challenge](https://github.com/tractian/challenges/blob/main/mobile/README.md).


And, as asked:

- A video demonstrating the app opening for each company and selecting a filter:

- Which points of the project I would improve if I had more time: I'd try to improve performance, to find out a better way to load super-large data (like that third company), and maybe I'd think about some new features.

## Run Locally

1. Clone this repository into your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/proz-tecnologia/PIT01GP08
```

2. In project root, and into each package, run this command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```
3. Everything working fine, without any errors, run the app with the following command:

```bash
flutter run 
```
